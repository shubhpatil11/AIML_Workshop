P - Pulling
F - 

Convolution -
Get an image of an 'X', and put it into a grid. Where the X exists , put 1 and else put -1
and then multiply 

Neural network: 

- Nodes, forward propogation
- epoch = to and fro of input and output
- Activation function: 
        Linear : 
            Relu - Range 0 to 1, does not activate for other values


- Loss function , vanishing gradient


Pulling :
    e.g Image shrinking
